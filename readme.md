## How to Run

This project can be run directly in your web browser using a local development server.

1.  **Install Live Server (if you don't have it):**
    If you use Visual Studio Code, you can install the "Live Server" extension. For other environments, you might need a different local server solution.
2.  **Open with Live Server:**
    Right-click on any `.html` file within the project directory (e.g., `index.html` or a specific test HTML file) and select "Open with Live Server." This will launch the page in your default web browser and automatically refresh it when you make changes to the files.
